This program builds on previous HW assignments

It adds parsing monster and object file capabilities

When parsing the data will be allocated to the correct parts of the characters and objects which are stored in an array of their
respective types

It will print the values that were read and stored

When using WINDOWS keep the s.erase() functions, if on LINUX comment them out.
WINDOWS has a '/r' at the end of the line as well as '/n' the erase function removes this for comparison reasons

The way main() is set up, don't enter any command after './game' and it will print the monster and object file info
