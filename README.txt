This program builds on previous assignments

This edition adds monsters with random qualities
Monsters can have intelligence, telepathy, tunnelling and erratic behavior

Intelligence allows the monster to use the roomMap or wholeMap to calculate the shortest path

Telepathy allows the monster to always remember the PC's location

Tunnelling allows the PC to go through mutable rock

Erratic behavior has a 50% chance of randomly moving to a neighbors cell rather than towards the PC

Monsters are defaulted to move randomly if they can't see the PC

Each characteristic has a 50% of being true

Added a "--nummon" (INT) to allow the user a varying number of monsters

The default value is 1 monsters

The MAX MONSTER size is 20!!!!!!
