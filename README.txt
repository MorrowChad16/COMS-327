This program builds on previous assignments

This edition adds user input on the pc after each round of movement

If you click 'a' or any key that isn't programmed to do something it will display all of the possible moves for the PC

You can move to any of the 8 surroundings cells of the PC

I display messages at the bottom of the dungeon rather than the top. I prefer this, hopefully I don't lose points because of this.

The monster list is seperate window from the dungeon window

Whoever moves to the current cell occupied and theres another character there wins the fight automatically

YOU MUST ADD A COMMAND AFTER ./game TO AVOID A SEGMENTATION FAULT, DO NOT LEAVE IT BLANK!!!!
