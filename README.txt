This program builds on previous HW assignments

This one adds color to our monsters and objects on the dungeon floor

We are now generating the monsters and objects from the text files parsed last assignment

Every other action is the same with monsters and pc usage

Objects can not be picked up right now, they can only be walked over

use the command './game' to render the game
