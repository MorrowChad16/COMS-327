Added a boolean like pre-for loop to check if space was occupied
Added corridor generation, but I am receiving floating point exception
Added up and down staircases

2-5: I created the read and write functions for the dungeon with every part working properly

2-6: I added Endian fixes
I added connections to the integer references for key characteristics like number of rooms, etc.
I added a malloc line for assigning space for our path/directory
Implemented sub cases within the fuctions if it is loading the dungeon and not creating one
Failed to implement in stairs
Failed to implement switch case due to confusion with calling them

The switch was implemented with --save, --load, and --load--save
