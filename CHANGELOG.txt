1-24: Created the game viewing border and area.
Created random room generator

1-25: Added rooms array to contain all rooms and their traits

1-26: Added 6 or more rooms functionality
Added a boolean like pre-for loop to check if space was occupied
Added corridor generation, but I am receiving floating point exception
Added up and down staircases

1-28: I implemented a way to avoid the floating pointer issue

2-5: I created the read and write functions for the dungeon with every part working properly

2-6: I added Endian fixes
I added connections to the integer references for key characteristics like number of rooms, etc.
I added a malloc line for assigning space for our path/directory
Implemented sub cases within the fuctions if it is loading the dungeon and not creating one
Failed to implement in stairs
Failed to implement switch case due to confusion with calling them

2-7: I fixed the stair issue, I was calling the wrong address of the saved file for the coordinates and number
The switch was implemented with --save, --load, and --load--save

2-9: I created the struct to contain all of the "heat maps"
I created two functions. One for generating the room heat map and the other for generating the entire map heat map

2-10: I added all of the initializations for the x, y, and cost with the pc being the first non-INT_MAX spot for the heap and algorithm

2-13: My output was not printing the correct cost for each cell
I added a measure to check if the cell had already been checked

2-14: My room function is able to print a perfect integer depiction of the room heat map, but unable to convert to a char map for an unknown reason
I added functionality to the whole map function, only changing the added weight and removing the hardness check when adding cost

2-15:I fixed the casting to a char issue by realizing I can store the variables in an int array and then print only what I need with the
other values being left out. Never changing the internals of the array.

2-19: I added a function to generate monsters with random characteristics
I added a while loop to generate a set number of monsters

2-20: I created a function that determines if the monster is in the same room as the PC so it remembers its coordinates
I added the --nummon command to take in the number of monsters the user wants

2-21: I added functionality for default monsters
I added functionality for the erratic monsters

2-22: I added the functionality for the telepathic monsters

2-23: I added the functionality for the tunnelling monsters
I added a function that deletes a monster form the character array when it is beaten

2-24: I added the functionality for the intelligent monsters
I have a segmentation fault when I have multiple monsters, but have yet to investigate the issue

2-26: I added a PC and NPC struct to seperate the characteristics
I fixed the segmentation fault. Just a logic error when determining move location

2-27: I malloced the character array and free'd it once a monster found the PC
